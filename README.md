# OEI
Open Efficiency Initiative (OEI) enabling commercial whole building energy efficiency programs to be more efficient and gain more value from data. The effort was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and was a collaboration with The Energy Coalition (TEC), City of San Francisco, Xcel Energy, and Vermont Energy Investment Corportation (VEIC).

This repository has resources developed by OEI. It includes folders for documentation of a full Benchmark use case; and sample code for connecting to EDAPT, ESPM, and Green Button Connect (GBC) OAuth 2.0.   

The Benchmark use case was piloted with the City of San Francisco to support their Benchmarking mandate. The City of San Francisco is importing ESPM benchmarking data into SEED. They are then transfering some of the data into Salesforce. The use case provides the automation of data from SEED to Salesforce via MuleSoft Community Edition API. Ituses the OEI Salesforce Managed Package that includes a Benchmark object.

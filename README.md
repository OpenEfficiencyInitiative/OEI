# OEP

Open Efficiency Platform (OEP) is an initiative to help commercial whole building energy efficiency programs to be more efficient and gain more value from data. It involved pilots that focused on exploring use cases for existing Federal tools and industry standards and their integration to support programs. The effort was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and was a collaboration with The Energy Coalition (TEC), City of San Francisco, Xcel Energy, NREL, Cadmus, SKEE, and Vermont Energy Investment Corportation (VEIC).

This repository houses open source resources developed as part of OEP; made publicly available to support the adoption by the industry of these resources. It includes folders for documentation of a full Benchmark use case, the OEI Salesforce Manged Package, and sample code for connecting to Energy Design Assistance Program Tracker (EDAPT), ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager (ESPM), and Green Button Connect (GBC) OAuth 2.0.

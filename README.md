# OEI
Open Efficiency Initiative (OEI) is an initiative to help commercial whole building energy efficiency programs to be more efficient and gain more value from data. It involved pilots that focused on explore the use cases of existing Federal tools and industry standards to support programs. The effort was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and was a collaboration with The Energy Coalition (TEC), City of San Francisco, Xcel Energy, and Vermont Energy Investment Corportation (VEIC).

This repository has resources developed by OEI. It includes folders for documentation of a full Benchmark use case; and sample code for connecting to EDAPT, ESPM, and Green Button Connect (GBC) OAuth 2.0.   

The Benchmark use case was piloted with the City of San Francisco to support their Benchmarking mandate. The City of San Francisco is importing ESPM benchmarking data into SEED. They are then transfering some of the data into Salesforce. The use case provides the automation of data from SEED to Salesforce via MuleSoft Community Edition API. It uses the OEI Salesforce Managed Package that includes a custom Benchmark object and the Account and Contact standard Salesforce objects. Automation of data flow between SEED and Salesforce is triggered by SEED Labels.
